    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Coronavirus non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) is a large multidomain protein essential for viral replication... 
    Our study biochemically characterizes Nsp3 and its papain-like protease (PLpro) domain, compares enzymatic 
    activity, and screens inhibitors including nanobodies as potential therapeutic tools.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and ISGylation are critical in host immune responses...
    PLpro antagonizes host ubiquitylation and ISGylation, subverting antiviral signaling and immune defense, making it 
    a potential drug target for COVID-19.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="methods">
    <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
    <p>We expressed and purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 and PLpro variants, performed enzymatic assays, 
    used MALDI-TOF high-throughput screening to evaluate 1971 FDA-approved compounds, and developed inhibitory nanobodies.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Extended Nsp3 acts as a more active protease than PLpro alone, efficiently cleaving ISG15, K48-linked chains, 
    and viral polyprotein substrates. Despite initial in vitro inhibition, none of the FDA-approved compounds showed 
    antiviral efficacy. Novel nanobodies, however, effectively inhibited PLpro activity.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="discussion">
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>Our findings highlight Nsp3â€™s central role in SARS-CoV-2 replication and immune evasion. While small molecule 
    inhibitors lacked efficacy, nanobody-based inhibitors provide a promising therapeutic strategy.</p>
